# Participate in the activities of the NCC Second Floor

The _NCC Second Floor_ is a technical topic sharing column launched by TheNCC, which was founded at the end of 2023.

The _NCC Second Floor_ adopts the way of live streaming + recording. It periodically conducts online technical sharing sessions through live broadcasts, and after the live broadcast ends, the recorded videos are uploaded to video-sharing websites for more community members to watch.

Whether you are a viewer, listener, or want to become our speaker, you can learn about and participate in the _NCC Second Floor_ through the following ways.
